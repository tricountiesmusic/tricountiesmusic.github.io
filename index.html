         <p>Dear Music Students, Music Teachers, School Principals, and Superintendents,</p>
         <p>We are proud to announce the 21st Annual Tri-Counties Music Competition sponsored by the Yuba City Noon Kiwanis Club.  This year the competition will be held on <b>Saturday, March 25th, 2017</b> at the <b>St Andrew Presbyterian Church</b> in Yuba City, and is open to students from 1st grade through 12th who are studying classical music.</p>

         <p>As you know, it is important to support and encourage music study among young people. Performing can give students lifelong joy and fulfillment and provide a wide choice of career specialties.  It is for the purpose of discovering, encouraging and developing talent that the Tri-Counties Music Competition was founded and organized in 1997 by Judy Wales, a former music teacher and active musician in this area.</p>
         <p>The music scholarships for this competition are made available through the support of the Yuba City Noon Kiwanis club along with other individuals and businesses.  The Kiwanis Club will be hosting the competition, award presentation, and the Winners Concert.
Kiwanis members are proud of this competition and its continuing support of the music students in our communities.</p>

         <p>Sincerely,</p>
